Description
-----------
Adds a dynamic soundtrack system to KSP. Allows creating playlists of tracks and setting the conditions under which they are played. Some stockalike tracks by Kevin MacLeod are included, as is a replacement for the KSC birdsong ambiance based on a track by freesound.org user dobroide. This plugin also makes use of MPG123 and associated code, licenced under GNU LGPL v2 (included).


Installation
------------
Extract the entire contents of the zip to the root KSP folder, merging the folders with the existing KSP folders.


Usage
-----
Drop any new .wav, .ogg or .mp3 files you want to use into the Music folder, next to KSP.exe.
You can create as many sub folders here as you want to organise the tracks.
Start up KSP and go to the KSC or flight menu. Click on the music speaker icon in the application launcher to open the Soundtrack Editor.


Uninstallation
--------------
Delete the SoundtrackEditor folder from GameData.
Delete the Licenses, Music, Playlists and Sources folders from the root KSP folder (next to KSP.exe).
Delete the file libmpg123-0.dll from the Mono folder inside the KSP_Data and KSP_x64_Data folders.


More Music
----------
This mod includes a selection of tracks by Kevin MacLeod, composer of some of the music used in KSP. He has several thousand tracks, many in the same style as is used in KSP, available for free at incompetech.com.
